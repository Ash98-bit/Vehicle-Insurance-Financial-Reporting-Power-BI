## Project Overview  
Since my Power BI projects cannot be abstracted in a way that can showcase proprietary reports (like I did for my Master’s thesis), this project was designed using a publicly available dataset (see below). The objective is to leverage historical company data to highlight the financial issues faced by an insurance company and present them in a narrative that is both fact-driven and visually compelling.  
Storytelling with data is essential: numbers alone rarely persuade stakeholders, but when combined with context, structure, and visualization, they drive decisions. Power BI is used in this case as it offers a platform to connect raw data with clear, dynamic visualizations that make insights accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Approach & Methodology  
The approach draws from the principles and reporting tips taught by Prof. Cezar Chirila and influenced by resources such as [Chandoo.org](https://chandoo.org/wp/about/) and [How to Power BI](https://www.youtube.com/@HowtoPowerBI).  

The methodology focused on building a report that is not only functional but tells a **clear and persuasive story**. Key principles included:  

- **Why → What → How Flow**: Structuring the report to guide stakeholders from context, to insights, to actionable decisions.  
- **Logos, Pathos, Ethos**: Ensuring the report appeals logically with facts, emotionally with relevance, and credibly with sound design.  
- **High-Contrast, Clean Visualizations**: Removing clutter, emphasizing readability, and maintaining professional aesthetics.  
- **Optimizing Pixel-to-Information Ratio**: Maximizing the insight density per visual without overwhelming the viewer.  
- **Stakeholder Accessibility**: Designing dashboards that are intuitive for non-technical users while still rigorous for data-savvy audiences.  

The resulting Power BI report is thus designed to center **clarity, narrative, and impact**.

## Outcomes  
- **Grade:** 1 (on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the best)  
- Building this Power BI report offered a hands-on application of data storytelling principles.
- This project gave me a strong foundation in combining **data visualization, storytelling, and business communication** — showing how insights become actionable when framed within a clear narrative! :D
